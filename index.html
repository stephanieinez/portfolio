    <!-- <p>Stephanie Tassone</p>
    <p>
      I'm a developer based in Berlin mostly working in React.<br />
      Until I found my calling as a developer I worked as a journalist and
      marketing manager. Since finding myself in the world of web development
      I've worked for a variety of start-ups, built and designed websites for
      small businesses and contributed on open source projects. <br />
      I love design, and am passionite about making a designers UI dreams a
      reality.<br />
      My background in marketing means that I create websites with the eye of
      both a consumer and business, ensuring that a website is optimised to its
      full potential.<br />
